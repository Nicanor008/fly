## Learning Web Components
This repository serves as a learning resource for understanding and creating web components using vanilla JavaScript. Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create reusable custom elements in web pages and web apps.


## Introduction
Web components offer a standardized way to create reusable UI elements with encapsulated functionality, making them easier to maintain and share across projects. In this repository, we explore the fundamentals of web components and provide examples to help you get started with creating your own.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/learning-web-components.git
```
Then, you can explore the different components and examples provided in the repository.

## Components
### Base Component
The BaseComponent class serves as the foundation for creating web components. It encapsulates common functionality such as initializing the Shadow DOM, adding styles and HTML templates, and adding event listeners.

### Counter Component
The CounterComponent is an example of a simple counter implemented as a web component. It demonstrates how to create a custom element with reactive behavior, allowing users to increment and decrement a count value.

### Timer Component
The TimerComponent is another example of a web component that implements a simple timer. It showcases how to use intervals and event listeners to create dynamic UI elements.
